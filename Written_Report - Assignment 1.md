Assignment 1: Project Overview

- Overview of the Deliverables
    Deliverable One Overview
        The purpose of the first analysis was to break out the results of the campaigns for the Theater parent category based on the campaign's launch date.  We started by creating a years column in our table which will come in use later when the data is transitioned into a pivot table.  Then when a pivot table is created the filters are the Parent Cateogry, which we selected "Theater", and the yeras column that was mentioned previously.  The columns of this pivot table were the different outcomes we want to measure (successful, failed & canceled) and the rows included the different months of the year.  Then to more clearly represent this data we created a line chart to show the results for successful, failed and canceled outcomes of a campaign based on which month they were launched.  
    Deliverable Two Overview
        The purpose of the second deliverable is to view outcomes of campaigns under the category of "plays" to see outcomes based on the goal fundraising price.  The division of fundraising goals were broken out by dollar amounts shown on the left hand column of the table, or the bottom of the chart.  The chart also shows the percentage of successful, failed or canceled campaigns based on the goal amounts.  

- Analysis of Deliverables
    Deiverable One Analysis
        The chart labeled "Theater Outcomes Based on Launch Date" shows how the outcomes of Theater campaigns change throughout the months of the year and depending on the filter selection can be changed to select specific years.  Currently all years are showing for the chart.  The challenges here would be making sure the right order & selection of the pivot table fields to ensure that we know the data reflect the results we are looking for. 
    Deliverable Two Analyis
        This campaign outcomes by goal table and graph shows how the different fundraising goals have different outcomes, note- no causation between goal amount and outcome should be made by this table and graph.  You can see though how the higher the fundraising goal correlates with fewer overall campaigns.  

- Results of Deliverables
    Deliverable One Results
        From the chart "Theater Outcomes by Launch Date" we can determine two items.  The first is that there are more campaigns launched in the middle of the year, April through August, than in the first or last quarters of the year and the growth of those campaigns seem to mostly be successful.  The other result we can conclude from the chart is that in every month the most common result is a succussful campaign, though the spread is different throughout the year between successful and failed.  Other conclusions about why campaigns are succussful or why certain months are better to launch campaings than others would be pure speculation and beyond the analysis of this chart.  
    Deliverable Two Results
        The "Outcomes Based on Goal" chart shows how the percentage of succusful vs failed campaigns varies based on increasing goal amounts.  From the chart you can see little correlation between the goal and whether the campaign had a successful or failed campaign but it is worth noting that none of the campaigns had canceled outcomes.  This chart again should not be used to try and derive in causation in what makes a campaign successful or a failed campaign.  Such analysis would require further investigation.
